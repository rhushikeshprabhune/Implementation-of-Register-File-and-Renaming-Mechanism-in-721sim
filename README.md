# Implementation-of-Register-File-and-Renaming-Mechanism-in-721sim
1) Implemented register file and renaming mechanism for RISC-V out-of-order superscalar processor in C++ by designing
components required for the stage.

2) Designed the active list, free list, renaming map table, architectural map table, physical register file and the control path
to create the entire renaming stage of the pipeline.
